**Class Notes**

**No transcription found**

As there is no context provided, I am unable to create structured class notes. Please provide the context or information you would like me to summarize, and I will be happy to assist you in creating notes in .md format.

If you provide the context, I can summarize the main points and create structured notes with key topics, subpoints, and important details in the following format:

```
### Topic 1
#### Subtopic 1.1
* Important detail 1
* Important detail 2

#### Subtopic 1.2
* Important detail 3
* Important detail 4

### Topic 2
#### Subtopic 2.1
* Important detail 5
* Important detail 6

#### Subtopic 2.2
* Important detail 7
* Important detail 8
```

Please provide the context, and I will do my best to create structured class notes in .md format.
