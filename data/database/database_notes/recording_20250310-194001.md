**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonality**

### Key Topics

* Finding the closest point on a line to a given point
* Orthogonality of directions
* Minimizing the distance between a point and a subspace
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its relation to orthogonality

### Subpoints

* Finding the closest point on a line to a given point:
	+ Define alpha as the parameter of the line
	+ Minimize the distance between the point and the line using the expression: `alpha = argmin ||p - t \* u||^2`
	+ Derive the derivative and set it to zero to find the optimal alpha
* Orthogonality of directions:
	+ Define two directions `u` and `v` as orthogonal if `u . v = 0`
	+ Show that the dot product of two orthogonal directions is zero
* Minimizing the distance between a point and a subspace:
	+ Define the subspace as a set of orthogonal directions
	+ Minimize the distance between the point and the subspace using the expression: `alpha = argmin ||p - t \* u||^2`
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its relation to orthogonality:
	+ PCA is a method for finding the directions that capture the most variance in a dataset
	+ Orthogonality is a key property of PCA, as it ensures that the directions are independent and capture different aspects of the data

### Important Details

* The closest point on a line to a given point can be found by minimizing the distance between the point and the line
* The dot product of two orthogonal directions is zero
* The distance between a point and a subspace can be minimized by projecting the point onto the subspace
* PCA is a method for finding the directions that capture the most variance in a dataset, and orthogonality is a key property of PCA
