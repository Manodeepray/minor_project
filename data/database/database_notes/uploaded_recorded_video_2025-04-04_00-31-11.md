Since there is no context provided, I will assume that you want me to create a template for class notes in an .md format. Here is a basic template that you can use:

**Class Notes Template**
======================

### Topic 1: [Insert Topic Name]

#### Subpoints

* [Insert subpoint 1]
* [Insert subpoint 2]
* [Insert subpoint 3]

#### Important Details

* [Insert important detail 1]
* [Insert important detail 2]
* [Insert important detail 3]

### Topic 2: [Insert Topic Name]

#### Subpoints

* [Insert subpoint 1]
* [Insert subpoint 2]
* [Insert subpoint 3]

#### Important Details

* [Insert important detail 1]
* [Insert important detail 2]
* [Insert important detail 3]

### Conclusion

* [Insert conclusion]

You can add or remove sections as needed, and fill in the information as you take notes during class.
