Here are the structured class notes in an .md format:

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonality**

**Key Topics**

* Orthogonality of vectors
* Finding the closest point on a line to a given point
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Maximizing projected amount to find the principal component

**Subpoints**

* **Orthogonality of vectors**
	+ Definition: two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero
	+ Example: two unit vectors with a dot product of zero are orthogonal
* **Finding the closest point on a line to a given point**
	+ Problem: find the point on a line that is closest to a given point
	+ Solution: use the expression `alpha = (p - a) \* (b - a) / ||b - a||^2`, where `p` is the given point, `a` is a point on the line, and `b` is the direction vector of the line
	+ Intuition: the closest point is the point on the line that is orthogonal to the given point
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
	+ Definition: find the direction that captures the most variance in the data
	+ Example: in a dataset of temperature readings, find the direction that explains the most variation in the readings
* **Maximizing projected amount to find the principal component**
	+ Problem: find the direction that maximizes the projected amount of the data onto the line
	+ Solution: solve the optimization problem `maximize alpha` subject to `alpha >= 0`, where `alpha` is the projected amount
	+ Intuition: the principal component is the direction that maximizes the amount of variance captured in the data

**Important Details**

* The principal component is the direction that captures the most variance in the data
* The residual is the amount of variance that is not captured by the principal component
* The principal component can be found by maximizing the projected amount of the data onto the line
* The optimization problem can be solved using the expression `alpha = (p - a) \* (b - a) / ||b - a||^2`

**Code**

* No code is provided in the notes, but the optimization problem can be solved using a standard optimization algorithm such as gradient descent.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the points.
