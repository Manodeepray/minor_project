======================

Since there is no context provided, I couldn't create any class notes. If you provide the context, I'll be happy to help you summarize the main points and create structured class notes in an .md format.

If you want to store the notes in an .md file, you can simply copy-paste the following template and fill in the relevant information:

```
# Class Notes

## Key Topics

### Subpoints

* [Insert subpoint 1]
* [Insert subpoint 2]
* [Insert subpoint 3]

### Important Details

* [Insert important detail 1]
* [Insert important detail 2]
* [Insert important detail 3]
```

Just replace the placeholders with the actual information, and you're good to go!
