I'd be happy to help you create structured class notes in an .md format. Can you please provide the main points and key topics you'd like to include in the notes? Additionally, please let me know what kind of context or subject you're studying (e.g. math, science, history, etc.)?

Once I have this information, I'll help you create a well-organized and easy-to-read .md file that summarizes the main points and key topics.

Here's an example of what the .md file might look like:

**Class Notes**

**Key Topics**

* [Topic 1]
* [Topic 2]
* [Topic 3]

**Subpoints**

### [Topic 1]

* [Subpoint 1.1]: [Description]
* [Subpoint 1.2]: [Description]
* [Subpoint 1.3]: [Description]

### [Topic 2]

* [Subpoint 2.1]: [Description]
* [Subpoint 2.2]: [Description]
* [Subpoint 2.3]: [Description]

### [Topic 3]

* [Subpoint 3.1]: [Description]
* [Subpoint 3.2]: [Description]
* [Subpoint 3.3]: [Description]

**Important Details**

* [Important detail 1]: [Description]
* [Important detail 2]: [Description]
* [Important detail 3]: [Description]

Let me know when you're ready to provide the main points and context, and I'll help you create your .md file!
