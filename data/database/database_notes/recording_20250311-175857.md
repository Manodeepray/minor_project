**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Notes**
===============================

**Key Topics**

* Finding the closest point in a subspace to a given axis
* Minimizing the residual (distance) between the axis and the subspace
* Principal Component of Variation (PCV)
* Maximizing the projection of data onto a subspace

**Subpoints**

### Finding the Closest Point in a Subspace

* Given a subspace and a point, find the closest point in the subspace to the given point
* This is equivalent to minimizing the residual (distance) between the point and the subspace
* The residual is defined as the distance between the point and the closest point in the subspace

### Minimizing the Residual

* The residual is minimized when the projection of the point onto the subspace is as large as possible
* This is equivalent to maximizing the projection of the data onto the subspace
* The projection is defined as the dot product of the point and the subspace

### Principal Component of Variation (PCV)

* The PCV is the direction that captures the most variance in the data
* It is found by maximizing the projection of the data onto the subspace
* The PCV is the direction that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix

### Maximizing the Projection

* The projection is maximized when the alpha values are as large as possible
* The alpha values are constrained to live on the line defined by the subspace
* The minimization of the residual is equivalent to the maximization of the projection

### Residual and Projection

* The residual is defined as the distance between the point and the closest point in the subspace
* The projection is defined as the dot product of the point and the subspace
* The residual is minimized when the projection is as large as possible

### Normalization

* The alpha values are normalized to have unit length
* The normalization ensures that the projection is defined correctly

### Conclusion

* PCA is a method for finding the principal components of a dataset
* The principal components are the directions that capture the most variance in the data
* The principal components are found by maximizing the projection of the data onto the subspace

**Additional Notes**

* The optimization problem can be solved using eigenvalue decomposition
* The eigenvalues correspond to the amount of variance explained by each principal component
* The eigenvectors correspond to the directions of the principal components

**Homework**

* Solve the optimization problem using the maximization method
* Prove that the minimization of the residual is equivalent to the maximization of the projection
