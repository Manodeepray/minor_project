**Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Notes**
==========================================

### Introduction

* PCA is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional space.
* The goal is to capture the most variance in the data while keeping the dimensionality low.

### Residual and Subspace

* The residual measures the distance between a point in the original space and its projection onto a subspace.
* The subspace is a lower-dimensional space that captures the most variance in the data.

### Maximizing the Projected Amount

* One way to find the principal component of variation (PCV) is to maximize the projected amount onto a direction in the subspace.
* This can be done by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the residual.

### Equivalence of Maximization and Minimization

* Maximizing the projected amount is equivalent to minimizing the residual.
* This is because the residual is a measure of the distance between the original point and its projection onto the subspace.

### Normalization

* Normalization is important in PCA because it ensures that all directions in the subspace have the same scale.
* This allows us to compare the importance of each direction.

### Principal Component of Variation (PCV)

* PCV is the direction in the subspace that captures the most variance in the data.
* It is the direction that maximizes the projected amount onto the subspace.

### Important Facts

* The squares of the alpha values are proportional to the norms of the components.
* This means that the components with larger alpha values are more important.

### Upcoming Topics

* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
* The Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT)
* The cocktail problem
