Here are the structured class notes in an .md format:

**Class Notes: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

**Key Topics:**

* Finding the closest point in a subspace to a given point (axe)
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Maximizing the projected amount onto the subspace
* Minimizing the residual (distance from axe to the subspace)
* Equivalence of maximizing and minimizing approaches

**Subpoints:**

### Finding the Closest Point in a Subspace

* The problem: given a subspace and a point (axe), find the closest point in the subspace to the axe
* Solution: minimize the residual (distance from axe to the subspace)

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* Definition: finding the directions that capture the most variance in the data
* Goal: explain as much of the data as possible using a low-dimensional subspace
* Maximizing the projected amount onto the subspace: equivalent to minimizing the residual

### Equivalence of Maximizing and Minimizing Approaches

* The two approaches are equivalent: maximizing the projected amount and minimizing the residual
* The alpha values (projections onto the subspace) are constrained to live on the line
* The closest point in the subspace is well-defined

### Normalization and Projection

* Normalizing the data: scaling the data to have equal importance (optional)
* Projection: finding the component of the data that lies in the subspace

### Notes on the Calculation

* The calculation involves solving an optimization problem: maximizing the projected amount or minimizing the residual
* The solution involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix

### References

* Linear Algebra
* PCA slides (optional)
