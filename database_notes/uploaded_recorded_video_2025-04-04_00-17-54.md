I'd be happy to help you create structured class notes in an.md file. Please provide me with the main points and any important details you'd like to include, and I'll format them in a clear and concise manner.

Here's a sample template to get us started:

**Class Notes**
================

**Key Topics**

### [Topic 1]

* [Subpoint 1]: [Brief description]
* [Subpoint 2]: [Brief description]
* [Important detail]: [Specific detail]

### [Topic 2]

* [Subpoint 1]: [Brief description]
* [Subpoint 2]: [Brief description]
* [Important detail]: [Specific detail]

### [Topic 3]

* [Subpoint 1]: [Brief description]
* [Subpoint 2]: [Brief description]
* [Important detail]: [Specific detail]

Let me know when you're ready to provide the main points and details, and I'll help you create the notes in this format!
