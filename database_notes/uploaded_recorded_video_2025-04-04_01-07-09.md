I'd be happy to help you with that. Since you didn't provide any context, I'll assume that you want me to create a template for structured class notes in markdown format. Here's a template you can use:

**Class Notes**
================

**Topic 1: Introduction to [Topic]**
------------------------------------

* **Key Points**
	+ [Point 1]
	+ [Point 2]
	+ [Point 3]
* **Subpoints**
	+ [Subpoint 1.1]
	+ [Subpoint 1.2]
	+ [Subpoint 1.3]
* **Important Details**
	+ [Important detail 1]
	+ [Important detail 2]
	+ [Important detail 3]

**Topic 2: [Topic]**
--------------------

* **Key Points**
	+ [Point 1]
	+ [Point 2]
	+ [Point 3]
* **Subpoints**
	+ [Subpoint 2.1]
	+ [Subpoint 2.2]
	+ [Subpoint 2.3]
* **Important Details**
	+ [Important detail 1]
	+ [Important detail 2]
	+ [Important detail 3]

**Topic 3: [Topic]**
--------------------

* **Key Points**
	+ [Point 1]
	+ [Point 2]
	+ [Point 3]
* **Subpoints**
	+ [Subpoint 3.1]
	+ [Subpoint 3.2]
	+ [Subpoint 3.3]
* **Important Details**
	+ [Important detail 1]
	+ [Important detail 2]
	+ [Important detail 3]

You can add or remove topics, key points, subpoints, and important details as needed. This is just a template to get you started.

Here's a sample output in markdown format:

```

You can save this template as a markdown file and fill in the information as you take notes during class.
