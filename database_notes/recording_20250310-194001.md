**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
===============

### Introduction

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that finds the most important directions in a dataset.
* The direction with the largest variance is called the first principal component, and the direction with the second largest variance is called the second principal component, and so on.

### Finding the Closest Point on a Line

* Given a line in a higher-dimensional space, find the closest point on the line to a given point `p`.
* The line can be parameterized as `t * u`, where `u` is a unit vector.
* The closest point is found by minimizing the distance between `p` and the line, which is equivalent to minimizing the distance between `p` and the projection of `p` onto the line.

### Computing the Projection

* The projection of `p` onto the line is given by `alpha * u`, where `alpha` is a scalar that satisfies the equation `alpha * u = p - (p \* u) * u`.
* The derivative of the distance with respect to `alpha` is zero at the optimal value of `alpha`, which is `alpha = (p \* u) / (u \* u)`.

### Generalizing to Higher-Dimensional Subspaces

* Given a subspace `S` spanned by `m` orthogonal vectors `u_1, ..., u_m`, find the closest point in `S` to a given point `p`.
* The closest point is found by minimizing the distance between `p` and the projection of `p` onto `S`.

### Computing the Projection

* The projection of `p` onto `S` is given by `alpha_1 * u_1 + ... + alpha_m * u_m`, where `alpha_1, ..., alpha_m` are scalars that satisfy the equations `alpha_1 * u_1 + ... + alpha_m * u_m = p - (p \* u_1) * u_1 - ... - (p \* u_m) * u_m`.
* The derivatives of the distance with respect to `alpha_1, ..., alpha_m` are zero at the optimal values of `alpha_1, ..., alpha_m`, which are `alpha_i = (p \* u_i) / (u_i \* u_i)`.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* PCA is a method for finding the most important directions in a dataset.
* The directions are found by maximizing the variance of the projections of the data onto the directions.
* The first principal component is the direction that captures the most variance, and the second principal component is the direction that captures the second most variance, and so on.

### Maximizing the Variance

* The variance of the projections of the data onto a direction `u` is given by `E[(p \* u)^2]`, where `p` is a random variable representing the data.
* The optimization problem is to maximize `E[(p \* u)^2]` subject to the constraint that `u` is a unit vector.
* The solution is given by `u = argmax E[(p \* u)^2]`, which is the direction that captures the most variance.

### Minimizing the Residual

* The residual is the distance between the data and the projection of the data onto the principal components.
* The minimization problem is to minimize the residual, which is equivalent to maximizing the variance of the projections onto the principal components.

### Conclusion

* PCA is a powerful technique for finding the most important directions in a dataset.
* The directions are found by maximizing the variance of the projections of the data onto the directions.
* The first principal component is the direction that captures the most variance, and the second principal component is the direction that captures the second most variance, and so on.
