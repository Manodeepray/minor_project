I'd be happy to help you with that. However, I need to know what topic or subject you would like me to create notes on. Please provide the context and information, and I'll create structured class notes in an .md format for you.

Once you provide the context, I'll use the following format to create the notes:

**Class Notes**
================

**Key Topics**
-------------

### [Topic 1]

* **Subpoint 1**: [Description]
* **Subpoint 2**: [Description]
* **Important Detail**: [Details]

### [Topic 2]

* **Subpoint 1**: [Description]
* **Subpoint 2**: [Description]
* **Important Detail**: [Details]

**Additional Resources**
----------------------

* [Reference 1]: [Description]
* [Reference 2]: [Description]

Let me know when you're ready to provide the context, and I'll get started!
