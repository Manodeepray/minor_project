I'm happy to help! However, I need to know what topic or subject you would like me to create class notes for. Please provide me with the context or topic, and I'll create a structured .md file with key topics, subpoints, and important details.

Once you provide the context, I'll create a .md file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Topic: [Insert Topic Here]

## Key Topics

### Subpoint 1: [Insert Subpoint Here]
* Important Detail 1
* Important Detail 2
* Important Detail 3

### Subpoint 2: [Insert Subpoint Here]
* Important Detail 1
* Important Detail 2
* Important Detail 3

### Subpoint 3: [Insert Subpoint Here]
* Important Detail 1
* Important Detail 2
* Important Detail 3
```

Please provide the context, and I'll get started on creating your class notes!
