I'd be happy to help you with that! Since there is no context or information provided, I'll assume you want me to create a generic class note structure for future use. Here is a sample .md file with a basic structure:

**Class Notes**
================

**Key Topics**

### I. Introduction

* Brief overview of the course
* Important dates and deadlines
* Course objectives and outcomes

### II. Topic 1: [Topic Name]

* **Subpoints**
	+ [Subpoint 1]: Definition and explanation
	+ [Subpoint 2]: Key concepts and theories
	+ [Subpoint 3]: Real-world applications and examples
* **Important Details**
	+ [Important detail 1]: Supporting evidence or research
	+ [Important detail 2]: Contrasting views or perspectives

### III. Topic 2: [Topic Name]

* **Subpoints**
	+ [Subpoint 1]: Definition and explanation
	+ [Subpoint 2]: Key concepts and theories
	+ [Subpoint 3]: Real-world applications and examples
* **Important Details**
	+ [Important detail 1]: Supporting evidence or research
	+ [Important detail 2]: Contrasting views or perspectives

### IV. Conclusion

* Summary of key points
* Takeaway messages and key takeaways
* Future learning objectives and next steps

You can add or remove sections and subpoints as needed, depending on the specific content and structure of your class notes. Simply copy and paste this template into a new .md file and fill in the relevant information.
