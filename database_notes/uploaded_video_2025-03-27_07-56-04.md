I'd be happy to help you with that. However, I need more information from you. Could you please provide the topic or subject you'd like to summarize and create structured class notes for? Additionally, what level of detail would you like me to include in the notes? Would you like me to include key terms, definitions, examples, or anything else?

Once I have this information, I can create a well-structured .md file for you that includes the main points, subpoints, and important details.

Please let me know how I can assist you further!
