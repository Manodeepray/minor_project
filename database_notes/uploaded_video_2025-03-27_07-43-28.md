I'd be happy to help you with that. Please provide the information you'd like me to summarize, and I'll create structured class notes for you in .md format.

You can provide the information by typing it out, and I'll help you organize it into key topics, subpoints, and important details. If you have any specific requirements or formatting preferences, feel free to let me know.

Once you provide the information, I'll help you create a well-structured .md file that you can easily store and refer to later.
