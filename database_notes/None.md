I'd be happy to help you create structured class notes in an `.md` file. Please provide the main points and details you'd like to include, and I'll format them according to your request.

If you haven't provided any context, I'll assume we're starting from scratch. Please go ahead and provide the main points and details you'd like to include in your class notes.

Here's a sample format to get us started:
