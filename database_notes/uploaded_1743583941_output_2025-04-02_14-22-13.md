I'd be happy to help you with that. Please provide the main points and information you'd like me to summarize and structure into class notes in an .md format. You can share the context and content, and I'll help you create a well-organized and easy-to-read summary.

Once you provide the content, I'll help you create a structured .md file with the following format:

```md
# Class Notes

## Key Topics
### Subpoints
#### Important Details

* [Main Point 1]
	+ [Subpoint 1]
	+ [Subpoint 2]
	+ [Important Detail]
* [Main Point 2]
	+ [Subpoint 1]
	+ [Subpoint 2]
	+ [Important Detail]
```

Let me know when you're ready to provide the content, and I'll help you create your .md file!
